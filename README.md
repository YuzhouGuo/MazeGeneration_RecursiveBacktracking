# MazeGeneration_RecursiveBacktracking
The recursive backtracking algorithm for generating small to medium size of mazes

I didn't upload the Library file to save some uploading time

### A quick demonstration:
To show the result of this project, we may see the code improvement from three stages:

* Stage one (Using OOP and create instance for each cell in the maze)

* Stage two (based on A*, with wall-avoiding algorithm added, you can see that the path is now trying to get to the middle of the path so that it is more human-like)

* Stage three (with advanced wall-avoiding strategy, and Bezier curve applied, visually more smooth)
