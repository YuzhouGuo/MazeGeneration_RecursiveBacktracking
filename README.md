# MazeGeneration_RecursiveBacktracking
The recursive backtracking algorithm for generating small to medium size of mazes

I didn't upload the Library file to save some uploading time

### A quick demonstration:
To show the result of this project, we may see the code improvement from three stages:

* Stage one (Using OOP and create instance for each cell in the maze)

![Slowest](Video_Demos/slowest.gif)

* Stage two (Using Bitwise Operation instead of creating objects)

![UsingBits](Video_Demos/usingBits.gif)

* Stage three (We don't draw the animations during Update() and use the algorithm for building only)
